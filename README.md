# Hand Gesture Recognition

Welcome to a collection of fun and interactive computer vision projects developed using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**! These projects utilize hand gesture detection to control games, draw in real-time, and more — all without touching the keyboard or mouse.

## 🔹 Projects Included

### 1. 🖌️ Air Canvas - Virtual Drawing Using Hand Gestures
Create drawings in the air using your index finger like a magic wand! 
- **Functionality:**
  - Move your index finger to draw.
  - Choose colors from a virtual color palette.
  - Open palm clears the canvas (acts as an eraser).
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV, MediaPipe
- **Use Case:** Touchless drawing and creative expression using only gestures.

### 2. 🎮 Subway Surfers Controller with Hand Gestures
Control the popular game **Subway Surfers** using simple hand gestures.
- **Functionality:**
  - Swipe Left → Move Left
  - Swipe Right → Move Right
  - One Finger → Jump
  - Open Palm (Five Fingers) → Pause
  - Two Fingers → Crouch
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI
- **Use Case:** Gesture-based game interaction for immersive, hands-free play.

### 3. ✌️ Gesture Identifier
Recognize and display specific hand gestures in real-time.
- **Functionality:**
  - Detects peace sign, thumbs up, open palm, etc.
  - Displays the name of the gesture on the screen.
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV, MediaPipe
- **Use Case:** Real-time gesture classification for applications like gesture-controlled UI, sign language basics, etc.

### 4. 🤚 Finger Counter
Counts how many fingers are currently held up and displays the number.
- **Functionality:**
  - Real-time finger detection.
  - Displays the count (0–5 fingers).
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV, MediaPipe
- **Use Case:** Simple finger-counting system useful in education or as a module in larger gesture control systems.
